# Surfs Up


## Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to help W. Avy determine if his surf and ice cream shop would bring in customers year round. To do this, it is necessary to learn more about weather trends at various times of the year, so W. Avy picked June and December; two months at opposite points in the year. By using the hawaii.sqlite database, I extracted all of the temperatures listed for these months and converted the data into a more understandable format through queries and Pandas Dataframes. This information is key to helping W. Avy run a successful surf and ice cream business, two activities that mostly require warmer temperatures.
