# Surfs Up


## Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to help W. Avy, an experience investor, determine if his surf and ice cream shop in Hawaii would bring in customers year round. To do this, it is necessary to learn more about weather trends at various times of the year, so W. Avy picked June and December: two months at opposite points in the year. By using the hawaii.sqlite database, I extracted all of the temperatures listed for these months and converted the data into a more understandable format through queries and Pandas Dataframes. This information is key to helping W. Avy run a successful surf and ice cream business, two activities that mostly require warmer temperatures.


## Results

- For the most part, the summary statistics between June and December are relatively similar. For example, the mean temperature for the month of June is about 74.9 degrees and the mean temperature for the month of December is about 71 degrees. Another instance is when comparing the maximum temperatures for the two months: the maximum temperature for June is 85 degrees and the maximum temperature for December is only 2 degrees lower at 83 degrees.
- One main difference in the summary statistics between the two months is the minimum temperature. The minimum temperature for June is 64 degrees and the minimum temperature for December is 56 degrees. Though it is not too drastic of a difference, W. Avy might have to prepare for those colder days in December when customers might not be interested in surfing or getting ice cream.
